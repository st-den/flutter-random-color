# Flutter Random Color Generator

Changes the background color to a random one on tap.

## Additional Features

- Shows a random primary Material color on long press.
- Shows the corresponding RGB values in the AppBar.
- The text color is dynamic, and is always readable.
- Has a button to copy the hex color code to the clipboard.
- Has a message with instructions for new users.
- The taps have that nice animated feedback effect, which is my personal favorite :)

Tested on Android, Web and Desktop.
